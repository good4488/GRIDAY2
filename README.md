# GRIDAY2

Some added features from GRIDAY
[GRIDAY](https://github.com/Sangwon91/GRIDAY)

## Added features
- Generate material shapes for porous materials (Gaussian grids)
- Calculate geometric descriptors using energy shapes (pore vol, surface area, channel dimensions..)
- Calculate adsorption descriptors using energy shapes (Henry coeff, heat of adsorption)
- Inaccessible pore detection
- Convert energy grid file to COTA code format (for GCMC simulations)
